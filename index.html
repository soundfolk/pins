            I was the first child of my parents when i was admitted in a sr. sec school in India, it was a very
            difficult
            phase for me as people out there used to call me an ugly guy, my face color was black and kind of an
            introvert i
            don’t know who put these thing in the minds of those little students at that time that there are black
            people
            who are dangerous and whites are friendly, umm.. i personally think that these are their parents, but
            according
            to me as i was a black when was a child i think that i was a kind of person who was really friendly but only
            if
            someone came to me to talk (as metioned i was an introvert ). You can bear almost everything the children
            say
            about you face, color and your personality but you can never bear if your teachers are against you i can’t
            say
            that my teacher were surely against me because of my color but ya whenever they used to see me they just
            make a
            very irritated face well, we will talk about them someday later but let me tell you the story of my school
            life
            whoch actually made it very threatning…….

            So i was in 6th grade when this happened, I was in the school ground in the front feild, it was the recess
            time
            and I was just having lunch with my friends(not really friends) they, i just got into a fight with one of my
            friend and he said me that he did not wanted to be my friend anymore, it was a group of approx 5 people
            including me, he just stood up and left and all the other 3 left with him calling me a dumb guy, i was
            really
            upset after that because they were the only friends of mine, do you think it must have stopped over here ?

            No, they just started to call me dumb in front of the whole class and it was really embarassing because they
            used to go to each and every student of my class and say this, and just after listening that the person
            starts
            laughing but its now good to tell that NOW THAT DUMB BOY is in the ONE OF THE MOST REPUTATED ENGENEERING
            COLLEGE
            OF INDIA : BITS PILANI

            Well to the summary time is the best healer this was just 1% of what i got from my school life the other 99%
            might be more worse to tell but to say time is the best healer..
